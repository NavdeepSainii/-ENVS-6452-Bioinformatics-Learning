# Introduction
This document outlines the steps for analyzing microbial community composition, including quality control, trimming, filtering, taxonomic assignment, and visualization.





# Set the working directory
# This ensures R knows where to find and save files for this project.
# Replace "~/Desktop/Bio/Assignment3" with your specific directory path.

```{r}

path <- setwd("~/Desktop/Bio/Assignment3")

## The 'setwd()' function sets the working directory to the specified path.
# Use this command each time you restart R or if your computer sleeps and resumes.
# The working directory resets after closing R, so re-run this command if needed.
```


```{r}
# Always load the basic libraries at the beginning of your script
# These libraries are essential for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(dada2); packageVersion("dada2")
```

```{r}
# List all files in the specified directory
# 'path' is the working directory set earlier using setwd()
list.files(path)
```


```{r}
# Step 1: Quality Control
# List and sort the forward and reverse FASTQ files
# This ensures the files are correctly paired for downstream processing.
fnFs <- sort(list.files(path, pattern="_R1_001.fastq", full.names = TRUE))
fnRs <- sort(list.files(path, pattern="_R2_001.fastq", full.names = TRUE))
```

```{r}
# Extract sample names to track each file pair by a unique identifier
# `basename()` removes the directory path, leaving only the filename.
# `strsplit()` splits the filename into parts based on the underscore (_) delimiter.
# `sapply()` selects the first part of the filename (the sample name).
sample.names <- sapply(strsplit(basename(fnFs), "_"), `[`, 1)
```

```{r}
# Visualize the quality profiles of forward and reverse reads
# This step generates plots of the quality scores for the first two forward and reverse FASTQ files.
plotQualityProfile(fnFs[1:2])
plotQualityProfile(fnRs[1:2])
```

```{r}
# Assign filenames for the filtered forward and reverse FASTQ files
# These files will be stored in a subdirectory named "filtered" within the working directory.

# Forward reads: Create file paths for filtered files
filtFs <- file.path(path, "filtered", paste0(sample.names, "_F_filt.fastq.gz"))

# Reverse reads: Create file paths for filtered files
filtRs <- file.path(path, "filtered", paste0(sample.names, "_R_filt.fastq.gz"))

# Assign sample names as the names for the filtered file paths
# This ensures the filtered files are correctly linked to their respective samples.
names(filtFs) <- sample.names
names(filtRs) <- sample.names
```


```{r}
# Perform quality filtering and trimming on the forward and reverse reads
# Outputs a summary table ('out') showing the number of reads retained after filtering

                     truncQ=2,             # Truncate reads at the first instance of a quality score of 2 or less
                     rm.phix=TRUE,         # Remove any reads that match the phiX genome (a common sequencing control)
                     compress=TRUE,        # Save output files in compressed format (gzipped)

# Load necessary libraries for microbial analysis and visualization
# These libraries are essential for processing, analyzing, and visualizing microbiome data


#### Prerequisites
#Ensure all libraries are installed before running the script. Use the following commands to install them if necessary:

##install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr"))
##if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    ##install.packages("BiocManager")
##BiocManager::install(c("phyloseq", "Biostrings"))

library(phyloseq); packageVersion("phyloseq")
library(Biostrings); packageVersion("Biostrings")
library(ggplot2); packageVersion("ggplot2")
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
#Saving as you go, just in case if in future we need to start from these objects
##Save output as taxa as a csv file to my computer

write.csv (taxa,file = "~/Desktop/Bio/Assignment3/taxa.csv")

write.csv (seqtab.nochim,file = "~/Desktop/Bio/Assignment3/topseq.nochim.csv")

write.csv (track,file = "~/Desktop/Bio/Assignment3/track.csv")
```


```{r}

##### what file I want to work with 
taxa <- read.csv ("~/Desktop/Bio/Assignment3/taxa.csv")
seqtab.nochim <- read.csv ("~/Desktop/Bio/Assignment3/topseq.nochim.csv")
```

```{r}
###This is to transpose data in case if I have to do that 
flipped_seqtab.nochim <- as.data.frame(t(seqtab.nochim))
View(flipped_seqtab.nochim)
```


```{r}
#####To take the sample id from a 1st row to the first(header) as a name so because we don't wnt the numbers to be treated as a result of the sample however, instead of numbers of the sample ID make it as a name of the sample id 
####This command copied the first row of the data frame


names(flipped_seqtab.nochim) <- flipped_seqtab.nochim[1,]


##### copying the first row means it is 2 times in the data frame now so the one has to be deleted
##Deleting the first now


flipped_seqtab.nochim <- flipped_seqtab.nochim[-1,]
write.csv(flipped_seqtab.nochim, file = "~/Desktop/Bio/Assignment3/flipped_seqtab.nochim.csv")


##Now to merge two files, in this case merging seqtab with taxa is 
OTUabund <- cbind(flipped_seqtab.nochim, taxa)
write.csv(OTUabund, file = "~/Desktop/Bio/Assignment3/OTUabund.csv")

rownames(flipped_seqtab.nochim) <- paste0("ASV", 1:nrow(flipped_seqtab.nochim))
```

```{r}
##Converts the seqtab.nochim object, which likely is a matrix or another type of R object, into a data frame.
seqtab.nochim <- data.frame(seqtab.nochim)
## Extracts the row names from the seqtab.nochim data frame and stores them in samples.out.
samples.out <- rownames(seqtab.nochim)

##Creates a new data frame (samdf) that contains just one column, which is samples.out (the sample names).
samdf <- data.frame(samples.out)

#Sets the row names of the samdf data frame to be the same as the values in samples.out.
rownames(samdf) <- samples.out

##Converts the samdf data frame into a matrix.
samdf <- as.matrix(samdf)
```

```{r}
##Load OTU abundance data (OTUmat.csv) and taxonomy data (taxamat.csv) from CSV files into R.
##The data is initially stored as data frames because by default when R reads csv file it reads data as data frame which means that they could have different data types for each column (e.g., character, numeric). To use them in phyloseq, they need to be converted to matrices with numerical data.

uparse_otus <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Bio/Assignment3/OTUmat.csv")

uparse_taxa <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Bio/Assignment3/taxamat.csv")
 

##Purpose: Convert the OTU table (uparse_otus) and taxonomy table (uparse_taxa) from data frames into matrices.
#Phyloseq package requires the abundance and taxonomy data in a matrix form.
###Note: Converting to a matrix ensures that all data in the table is of a single type, typically numeric for abundance data, which is crucial for calculations.

# Convert the OTU table and taxonomy table from data frames into matrices
otumat <- as.matrix(uparse_otus)
taxamat <- as.matrix(uparse_taxa)



# Assign unique row names to each OTU, such as "OTU1", "OTU2", etc.
rownames(otumat) <- paste0("OTU", 1:nrow(otumat))
rownames(taxamat) <- paste0("OTU", 1:nrow(taxamat))
 

##This check ensures that both the abundance table (OTU counts) and the taxonomy table have the same number of rows. If they don’t match, phyloseq can’t connect abundance counts with their taxonomy, leading to an error.

if (nrow(otumat) != nrow(taxamat)) {
  stop("The number of OTUs in the abundance and taxonomy tables are not the same!")
}


##To check the structure of the object
str(otumat)  
str(taxamat) 


class(otumat)
 
class(taxamat)

class(uparse_otus)
class(uparse_taxa)
```


```{r}
# Create phyloseq components
OTU <- otu_table(otumat, taxa_are_rows = TRUE) 
TAX <- tax_table(taxamat)


# Create a phyloseq object
ps <- phyloseq(OTU, TAX)
```

```{r}
## Viewing this object gives an output of how many rows otu_table and taxa table has 
ps
```

```{r}
sample_names(ps)
```


```{r}
# Get sample names from the ps object
samplenames <- sample_names(ps)
print(samplenames)
